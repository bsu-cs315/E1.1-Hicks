Devlin Hicks's Exercise 1.1 Report:
	This exercise is a demonstration of 2D game physics. The game has a resemblance in some aspects to
	the game Angry Birds. The difference is this game does not use the assets of the game. The game is extremely simple.
	You control a ball that falls to the ground. There are wooden pieces on the opposite side of the platform.
	The goal is to knock these pieces down and have them fall over. This is accomplished by having rigid bodies, collision shapes, and sprites. 
	You use the W, A, S, and D keys to control the direction of the ball and the space bar to launch the ball.
	There is also a power indicator at the top left of the screen. 
	If you press the up and down arrows, you can increase or decrease the power the ball launches at.
	The purpose of this game is to fulfill a series of objectives laid out for us.
	 These would include controls,
	proper licenses, and more. 
	To this end, I believe I have fulfilled the requirements laid out.
